# UCL Restaurant recommendations - Collaborative Filtering

This project is based on the restaurant and consumer dataset from UCI. 
Available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Restaurant+%26+consumer+data).

Starting with a data cleaning process and EDA, I am ending with a recommender engine based on the cosine similarity between product features.
